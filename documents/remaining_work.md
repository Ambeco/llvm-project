# Remaining work

See `documents/design.md` for overall context and `ai-notes/wip.md` for
the full narrative/detail behind each item below.

## Done: dedicated file-I/O thread + in-wasm RPC, wired into the driver

See `documents/threaded-file-io-rpc-plan.md` for the full design notes,
constraints, and build order. Summary: confirmed that sharing a plain fd
across wasi-threads workers fails (`EBADF`), since each worker gets its
own independent host WASI instance/fd table. Fix: one dedicated
I/O-owning thread, every other thread RPCs to it over a single-slot
shared-memory mailbox (spinlock + plain-atomic spin, no
`memory.atomic.wait32`), intercepting the raw WASI Preview1 import layer
rather than the POSIX layer. **Implemented, built as a real compiler-rt
component (`clang_rt.wasi_threaded_io`), and wired into
`clang/lib/Driver/ToolChains/WebAssembly.cpp` so every `-pthread`
WASI-threads output binary links it automatically** (opt out with
`-mno-wasi-threaded-io`); verified end-to-end against a real rebuild of
clang.wasm/lld.wasm, including the actual generated `wasm-ld` command
line in both the shim-enabled and shim-disabled directions. The same
change fixed an adjacent gap where `--shared-memory` was auto-added for
`-pthread` WASI-threads targets but `--import-memory` never was.

### Done: verify the single-threaded build is unaffected

Built `build-single-threaded.bat`'s clang.wasm/lld.wasm from scratch and
confirmed a real compile+link+run ("Hello, world!") produces correct
non-threaded output — item 1 of the checklist, fully passed. Item 2 is
mixed: the no-flag default and `-mno-wasi-threaded-io` are both silently
inert as expected (byte-identical `wasm-ld` invocations, shim absent),
but explicit `-mwasi-threaded-io` **fails to link**
(`libclang_rt.wasi_threaded_io.a: No such file or directory`) rather than
being inert — a real, confirmed defect, not just the predicted risk. See
`documents/threaded-file-io-rpc-plan.md`'s "Follow-up: verify the
single-threaded build is unaffected" section for full detail, including
a second bug found and fixed along the way: `compiler-rt/lib/wasi_threaded_io/CMakeLists.txt`
was unconditionally requesting `ARCHS wasm32`, which hard-failed LLVM's
NATIVE cross-compile-host sub-build (used for host-native tblgen tools)
the moment it was freshly configured — fixed by skipping the component
when `LLVM_TARGET_IS_CROSSCOMPILE_HOST`. That bug had also gone
undetected in `build.bat`'s own prior "from-scratch" verification, whose
`build/NATIVE` cache was never actually reconfigured after
`wasi_threaded_io` was added.

### Done: fix `-mwasi-threaded-io`'s link failure on non-atomics targets

Fixed by checking whether the resolved `clang_rt.wasi_threaded_io`
archive actually exists before appending it to the link
(`wasm::Linker::ConstructJob` in `clang/lib/Driver/ToolChains/WebAssembly.cpp`),
rather than gating on target/flag heuristics (confirmed those can't
predict archive validity — see the plan doc). Emits a new, detailed
diagnostic (`err_drv_wasi_threaded_io_unavailable`) explaining why and
suggesting `-mno-wasi-threaded-io` when it's missing, instead of letting
`wasm-ld`'s cryptic "no such file" error surface. Verified against the
real single-threaded binary. See
`documents/threaded-file-io-rpc-plan.md`'s "Correction found while
starting this follow-up" section for full detail.

### Still open (deferred, not scheduled): linking the shim into clang.wasm itself

Whether/how to link `wasi_threaded_io` into clang.wasm's own binary
(separate from the output programs it compiles) remains an open question.
Earlier investigation suggested clang's own compile path may not exercise
real threading enough for this to matter in practice — worth
re-confirming before spending effort wiring it in there too.

## The real browser-based JS host (separate project, not started)

Everything under `ai-notes/*.mjs` is a Node reference implementation
proving the contract works — real compile, link, run, threading — not the
real target. A real implementation, likely in its own separate repo (not
a branch here), needs:
- A real browser `Worker` instead of Node's `worker_threads`.
- Handling a `Worker` that gets forcibly *terminated* — no in-wasm
  backtrace is possible on termination, so the hosting JS has to
  reconstruct/report failure itself.
- The hosting JS (not the terminated Worker) invoking cleanup
  (`RunInterruptHandlers()`/`CleanupOnSignal()`) when it terminates a
  Worker, since the wasm instance can't run any code once terminated.
- Verifying `wasm-wasi-core` (VS Code for Web's WASI host) doesn't share
  `node:wasi`'s limitation of hard-requiring an *exported* memory — a
  wasi-threads module by construction can only have an *imported* one.
  `documents/vscode-wasi-host.md` documents the confirmed API surface
  (`createProcess` does accept a `WebAssembly.Memory`/`MemoryDescriptor`),
  but this hasn't been exercised end-to-end against the real VS Code for
  Web host yet, only against Node.
- This is where a real debugger implementation would also need to live;
  `documents/vscode-wasi-host.md` was written with that in mind but no
  debugger work has started.

## Upstream contribution (`upstream-fixes` branch)

- No PR has been opened yet — hold off until asked.
- **Before opening one**, diff against
  [llvm/llvm-project#92677](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/92677)
  (open, unmerged, touching almost the same file list) and frame any PR as
  narrower in scope (this project never touches threading/`std::mutex`
  conditionalization, which is what stalled #92677 — see `ai-notes/wip.md`
  for the detailed history).
- Re-check whether any `upstream-fixes` commit gets superseded by upstream
  `main` moving on its own, the same way the original `__WASM__`/`__wasm__`
  typo fix did, on every future rebase.

## Housekeeping / known fragile spots

- `build.bat` hardcodes `lib/clang/24/...` (the current LLVM major
  version) for the second, non-threaded compiler-rt build's output path.
  Will break silently on the next version bump; should be made
  version-agnostic like the JS smoke tests' `findResourceDir()`.
- Re-verify the full 18-commit cherry-pick sequence still applies cleanly
  on the *next* rebase onto a fresh `main` snapshot; it applied with zero
  manual conflicts last time, but that's not guaranteed to hold forever.

## Explicitly deferred, not forgotten

- `clangd` support: raised as a likely-harder future problem (persistent
  background indexing threads, not a one-shot spawn-and-wait like `cc1`).
  `clang-tools-extra` isn't even enabled in `LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS` yet.
  Not attempted; worth its own investigation pass whenever it's prioritized.
- Subprocess I/O redirection, timeouts, polling, and detached-process
  support in `Unix/Program.inc` — currently fail loudly rather than
  silently no-op'ing. Nothing in a normal compile/link needs these yet;
  extend the wire format + spawn shim only if a real use case appears.
- `CrashRecoveryContext::Enable()` and socket operations remain hard
  stubs — deliberate, not a gap: `CLANG_SPAWN_CC1=ON` means
  `CrashRecoveryContext::Enable()` is dead code in this configuration, and
  sockets were never expected to work in a browser-hosted compiler.
- Real in-module threading's actual performance payoff at realistic
  project sizes hasn't been measured beyond confirming it's a no-op for
  trivial one-file workloads (below `ThreadPoolStrategy`'s worker-count
  threshold). Worth revisiting with a genuinely large compile/link before
  assuming this milestone delivers a measurable speedup in practice, versus
  "compiles and links correctly with threading enabled, mostly unexercised
  so far except by lld's parallel section-writing path."
